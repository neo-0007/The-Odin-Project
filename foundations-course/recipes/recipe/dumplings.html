        <li>In a bowl, combine flour and salt. Gradually add water and knead until a smooth dough forms. Cover and let
            it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix ground meat, chopped vegetables, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and egg (if
            using) until well combined.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface and cut it into small circles (about 3 inches in diameter).</li>
        <li>Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of each dough circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, sealing the edges by pinching or pleating.</li>
        <li>Prepare your cooking method: steam, boil, or pan-fry the dumplings.</li>
        <li>If steaming, place dumplings in a steamer for about 15 minutes. If boiling, cook in salted water until they
