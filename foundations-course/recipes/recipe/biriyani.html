    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Biriyani is a cherished Indian dish renowned for its rich flavors and aromatic spices. Originating from the
        Persian word "birian," meaning "fried before cooking," it features layers of marinated meat—such as chicken,
        mutton, or fish—combined with fragrant basmati rice and spices like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. The
        slow-cooking method, or "dum," allows the flavors to meld beautifully, creating a hearty and satisfying meal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each region of India adds its unique twist to biriyani, making it a versatile dish. For instance, Hyderabad is
        famous for its spicy Hyderabadi biriyani, often served with raita, while Kolkata biriyani is known for its
        subtle flavors, including potatoes and boiled eggs. Whether at festive occasions or as a comforting weeknight
        meal, biriyani holds a special place in Indian cuisine, celebrated for bringing people together through a shared
        love of food.
